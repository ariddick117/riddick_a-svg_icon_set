# Assignment 1: Using SVG Artwork and JavaScript Events
# Overwatch Hero Icon Set

Creating an icon store using 25 hero characters from the popular video game, Overwatch. Each of the icons will grey-out when hovered over and respond with a text-based Javascript event when clicked.

25 hero characters were used instead of 10 in order to make a more complete list for the game itself.
